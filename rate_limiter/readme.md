# Asynchronous Rate Limiter

## Problem Statement

Implement an asynchronous rate limiter class that restricts the number of operations that can be performed within a specified time window. This is commonly used in API clients to adhere to server-side rate limits.

The rate limiter should:
1. Allow a specified number of operations per second
2. Automatically delay operations that would exceed the rate limit
3. Handle concurrent operations using Python's asyncio

## Requirements

```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, operations_per_second: int):
        # Initialize the rate limiter with operations allowed per second
        pass
        
    async def acquire(self) -> None:
        # Acquire permission to perform an operation
        # If the rate limit is exceeded, this coroutine should wait
        # until performing the operation would not exceed the rate limit
        pass
        
    async def execute(self, coroutine_func: Callable[..., Awaitable[T]], *args, **kwargs) -> T:
        # Execute a coroutine function with rate limiting
        # This method should:
        # 1. Acquire permission using self.acquire()
        # 2. Execute the provided coroutine function with the given arguments
        # 3. Return the result of the coroutine function
        pass
```

## Example Usage

```python
import asyncio
from rate_limiter import RateLimiter

async def main():
    # Create a rate limiter with 2 operations per second
    limiter = RateLimiter(2)
    
    async def make_request(request_id):
        print(f"Starting request {request_id}")
        # Simulate some work
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        print(f"Completed request {request_id}")
        return request_id
    
    # Execute 5 requests concurrently
    tasks = [limiter.execute(make_request, i) for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    print(f"Results: {results}")
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Expected Output
```
Starting request 0
Starting request 1
Completed request 0
Completed request 1
Starting request 2
Starting request 3
Completed request 2
Completed request 3
Starting request 4
Completed request 4
Results: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The output shows that requests 0 and 1 start immediately, followed by requests 2 and 3 after the first batch completes, and finally request 4. This demonstrates the rate limiting of 2 operations per second.

## Constraints
- The rate limiter should work with any coroutine function
- The rate limiter should be thread-safe and support concurrent operations
- The implementation should be efficient and not use busy-waiting
- The rate limiter should accurately maintain the specified rate limit
- Initialize with a positive operations_per_second value

## Test Cases Overview
Your implementation should pass the following tests:

1. Initialization with valid and invalid parameters
2. Acquisition within and exceeding the rate limit
3. Execution of coroutine functions within and exceeding the rate limit
4. Handling of multiple operations per second settings
5. Concurrent execution respecting rate limits
6. Error propagation from executed coroutines
7. Token bucket algorithm behavior allowing bursts
8. Handling of excessive operations
9. Rate limiting precision
10. Cancellation of pending acquisitions
11. Execution with complex arguments
12. Non-blocking behavior during rate limiting
13. Dynamic rate adjustment
